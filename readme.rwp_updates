Here's what I (Rob Porritt) added/changed:

default configs no longer have John's info ;)
Added config panel to fetch data via irisFetch.m
  I know you can change the datacenter base, which will allow using more datacenters such as orfeus or geophon
  I had to adjust the sizing of the config panel for this extra panel
Added auto-fetching of station coordinates
added mseed2sac v1 and v2 for file name conventions
Added a polar plot of split results to splitdiagnostic plots for legacy
