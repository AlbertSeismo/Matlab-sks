# splitlab

SplitLab is a Graphical User Interface to facilitate the processing of teleseismic shear-wave splitting observations. In contrast to a fully automated technique, we present a manual, per-event approach that maintains a user control during the sequence of processing. For more detail information, see the (SplitLab webpage)[http://splitting.gm.univ-montp2.fr/].
