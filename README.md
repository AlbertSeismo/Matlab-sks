# splitlab

SplitLab is a Graphical User Interface to facilitate the processing of teleseismic shear-wave splitting observations. In contrast to a fully automated technique, we present a manual, per-event approach that maintains a user control during the sequence of processing. For more information, see the [SplitLab webpage](http://splitting.gm.univ-montp2.fr/).

SplitLab is based on Matlab version 1.9.0 works on Matlab *R2015b* and *R2016a*.

Altohught most functionalties are tested, we recommand to use the tool with caution. We can not garantee for any bugs. However, we invite you to help us maintaining the software by reporting issues or, even better, by code contributions.
